# Awesome Cliodynamics [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge-flat.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> A curated list of awesome resources for cliodynamics — the quantitative study of historical dynamics and long-term social processes.

Cliodynamics is "...is a transdisciplinary area of research integrating historical macrosociology, cultural and social evolution, economic history/cliometrics, mathematical modeling of long-term social processes, and the construction and analysis of historical databases" [^description_reference].
